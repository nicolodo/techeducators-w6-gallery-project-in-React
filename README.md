User Stories
1🐿️ As a developer, I want the application to use the useState hook so that user interactions (like selecting an image) are smooth and the gallery’s state is managed effectively.
2🐿️ As a developer, I want to use the useEffect hook to perform side effects, such as fetching image data from an external API.
3🐿️ As a developer, I want to create separate files that return JSX instead of including all JSX within App.jsx so that the code is well-organized, making the app more maintainable and reliable for the user.
4🐿️ As a user, I want to see a collection of image thumbnails displayed clearly on the page.
5🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to click on an image thumbnail to view a larger version of that image, possibly in a modal or a dedicated view.
6🐿️ As a user who relies on assistive technologies, I want images to have descriptive alt text so I can understand their content.
7🐿️ As a user who navigates with a keyboard, I want to be able to tab through the interactive elements (like thumbnails and buttons) in a logical order.


Requirements
🎯 Implement the useState hook to manage gallery state (e.g. selected image).
🎯 Use useEffect for initial fetching of images from an external API.
🎯 Return JSX from multiple components (e.g., an ImageItem component for each image and a Gallery component to display them).
🎯 Use the .map() function to render an array of images dynamically
🎯 Implement functionality to display a larger version of an image when its thumbnail is clicked.
🎯 Ensure all images have meaningful alt text.
🎯 Ensure basic keyboard navigation for image selection (e.g., thumbnails should be focusable and activatable with Enter/Space).
How to Deploy
Aim to deploy on Render when you have enough time afterwards to debug any potential problems, which will be listed in the production logs.

To begin, ensure your project has been pushed to GitHub. Then, go to Render. You should already have an account at this point, but if not, make an account (or sign-in through GitHub).

Deploying a React App to Render
Click ‘+ New’ and choose ‘Static Site’.
Select the same project and click ‘Connect →’.
Here is what we need on the options page:
Build Command: npm install && npm run build (or npm install; npm run build, as should be pre-filled in for you)
Publish directory: dist
Environment variables: add anything in your client-side .env file in here.
Now, you can ‘Deploy Static Site’!
Stretch Goals
To achieve an 8/8 in your assignment, aim to achieve all of the requirements, plus some extra goals for each section of the marking rubric. This can be excellence in styling or something that demonstrates creativity or innovation in the week’s topics.

Below are some examples of stretch goals and user stories that you could add to your project, but are not expected to.

Stretch User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to change the images in the gallery using a search bar.
🐿️ As a developer, I want to be able to fetch images from an API with a larger amount of data, such as Unsplash.
🐿️ As a developer I don’t want anyone to know my API keys from code.
🐿️ As a user I want the app to look pleasing.
Stretch Requirements
🏹 Use useEffect and the dependancy array to update the images when the user types in an input field.
🏹 Set up an Unsplash application that you can fetch from your React app.
🏹 Use .env to hide your API keys and tokens from the code.
🏹 Style the application excellently, using grid or flex and positioning.
Reflection
Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

Required
🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Optional
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
What went really well and what could have gone better?
